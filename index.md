Hello, I am Abhinav Kumar. I'm a graduate from [BMS College of Engineering in Bangalore](https://www.bmsce.ac.in/), with a degree in computer science and engineering. Nowadays, learning microservices and go.

I have been actively involved in the open source community through the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program. As part of my contributions to the [Mifos Initiative](https://mifos.org/), I have helped develop the [Mifos Gazelle Runtime Demo](https://github.com/openMF/mifos-gazelle-demo-runtime) and contributed to [Mifos Gazelle](https://github.com/openMF/mifos-gazelle). During my time as a Software Intern at Mifos, I also worked on reducing the memory footprint of Mifos Gazelle, making it more efficient and scalable.

I have contributed to open source projects like <a href="https://github.com/kagent-dev/kagent">Kagent</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stan-smith/fossflow-lib">Fossflow-lib</a>, <a href="https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada">Karmada</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/opencost/opencost-website">Opencost (by IBM)</a>. I also did some fun internships at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b">Samsung R&D</a> (Summer 2024) and <a href="https://mifos.org/">Mifos</a> (Fall 2024). I also blog every now and then compiling my personal experiences; you can read my blog <a href="/archive/">here</a>.
