Software Engineer Intern | Mountain View, California, United States - Remote

[Mifos Initiative](https://mifos.org/): **Mifos** is an open-source platform providing financial services to **underserved communities**, enabling **microfinance** institutions and fintechs to deliver affordable and innovative **financial products**. 

Experience

I set up Mojafos from GitHub and explored the Mifos/Fineract, Mojaloop vNext, and PHEE components, deploying and reporting on the Mojaloop connector. I configured Renovate and re-deployed Mojafos for Mojaloop vNext Beta1. Additionally, I updated showUsage to reflect the latest features and deployed PHEE from a local Helm chart. Furthermore, I researched and implemented strategies to reduce the memory footprint for both Mojafos and the PHEE infrastructure.

[PolyPhy](https://polyphy.io/): **PolyPhy** is an *unconventional* toolkit for reconstructing **continuous networks** out of sparse 2D or 3D data. Such data can be defined as collections of discrete points, or a continuous sparse scalar field. PolyPhy produces a **scalar density** field that defines the recovered network structure.

I developed new features and fixed existing issues, including adding metadata saving in PPSimulation_2DContinuous, enhancing the 3D_discrete simulation GUI, and fixing assertion errors. I managed CI configurations and updates, such as removing macOS-11 from the CI matrix and updating Python versions in configuration files. Additionally, I refactored code for improved performance and maintainability by implementing type conversion and bounds check removal in data_step_2D_discrete and restructuring images for 2D discrete pipelines.

[P4 org](https://p4.org/): P4 is a *domain-specific language* designed for programming **network data planes**, enabling developers and network engineers to specify how packets are processed by devices like **switches** and **routers**. By using P4, new network features and behaviors can be implemented and updated rapidly, bypassing the traditionally slow, **vendor-controlled** feature rollout process.
