Hello everyone!
I am Abhinav Kumar. I'm a Prefinal year student at BMS College of Engineering in Bangalore, studying computer science and engineering. Along with my strong Linux system administration skills, I have expertise running cloud services on AWS and GCP. I've built CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and am adept in containerization with Docker. I'm also skilled at designing responsive web apps utilising Tailwind CSS and React.
